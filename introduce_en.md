```Description
Swarm invasion, void consumption
Heaven's will be done, humanity perishes...

A thousand years later, human technology advanced rapidly,
Yet not a single war had occurred...

Lacking wartime experience, humanity failed to realize two devastating invaders were approaching...

On April 8, 3020, the Puerto Rico weather observatory discovered supernatural fissures appearing in the earth.
These glowing blue cracks had faintly visible eyes staring back at the observing humans.

Meanwhile, a satellite from a certain country detected an unusual "meteorite" hurtling towards the solar system from a location 80 light-years away.
Some attempted to investigate the massive glowing fissures in Puerto Rico but never returned.

Over the next century, humanity gradually forgot about the strange fissures and the bizarre meteorite, dismissing them as jokes.
Until the day of destruction. Demons from the void tore open rifts, and an alien warship larger than the Moon descended into the upper atmosphere.

Monsters glowing blue all over, and giant Zerg-like creatures covered in tumors, simultaneously set their sights on the solar system.
The war they waged against each other also posed a grave threat to humanity.

Facing invasion from two enemy forces simultaneously, world leaders urgently recalled warfare systems from a thousand years past.
Using existing advanced technology, they hastily formed the Human Future Expeditionary Force (HFEF), determined to reclaim humanity's lost territories
and annihilate these two alien species on Earth, humanity's heritage.

This campaign was called "Sunset".
